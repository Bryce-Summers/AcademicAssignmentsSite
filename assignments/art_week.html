Critique: Is the meaning visible for far away? Can I make the font better with Bryce font?
Should I put the U there? Should it be off center? Could I have chosen better material properties for the ruler?


U is confusing.
Viewer didn't know this was a ruler.
Blue was confusing.
It presents itself like a tapeworm. Oh dear... It could have been a rope, measuring tape, etc.
Viewer thinks theat the end is the start.
Destination in center. Emphasize the start.
Emphasize the hast marks more than the shadows. Make those shadows grey.
shadows on top were more visually communicative to viewer.
Experiement with viewing it from a different perspective.
Consider not having the ruler go off of the page.
I want to show a rigid object bending, not a tape measure.
I will take a second pass at this with some Bryce font when I have some extra time.

I want users to have a system that allows them to talk to themselves. This is a commentary on fb, fake news, and homogenous ideas.
