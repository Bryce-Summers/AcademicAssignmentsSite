<td>Ariana</td>
<td>I like Ariana's sketchbook. I'm a fan of introspection as well, although sometimes I do it to an unhealthy degree. The sketchbook reminds me of how I would like to keep documents of my life so I can make jobs easier for future historians. <br><br>
The boots remind me of my boots, which I inherited from my grandfather. Needless to say they are a tad bit beat up and uncomfortable, but they beat letting water into my socks any day of the week. <br><br>
Ariana's relationship to her computer seems to be that of a designed useful object. This is different from my use, where they are my life companions that translate my logic into executions. My relationship is more emotional than platonic.

<td>Kathleen</td>
<td>
I don't think that Kathleen and I will bond over smart home technologies.
Kathleen's Roomba is interesting, but I still like good old fashion brooms. I also don't have much love for Alexa, because I like an old fashion google search. I'm also pretty sure I'm not a cup o' Joe kind of person.

<td>Gabriella</td>
<td>
Gabriella's passport story reminds me of how I grew up being a so called apolitical moderate. We never really went to protests, I never identified as a democrat or a republican, I never saw why it mattered who was president. These days like Gabriella, I've started to com out from my a political shell and am using my rights as a citizen to advocate for what I think is right. <br><br>
The kickwheel reminds me of my cooper wheel artifact growing up. I would also go to Collonial Williamsburgh alot and see cooper wheels there.<br><br>
I like that song. Gabriella mentioned it in class last semester and it reminds me of a nostalgic view of reality that I developed as a younger person from musicals, hollywood movies, cds, etc. While I never lived in that time, I get warm fuzzy feelings about it.

<h3>Love Letter.</h3>
<p>
Dear #2 Pencil,<br><br>

I love you and always follow your lead. We discuss semantics and get into graph  fights. You touch my hand and I move you the tears. Together we write upon planes of parchment and express ourselves. Our relationship goes beyond superficiality, because I have to continuously sharpen you and care for you in ways that mechanical pencil users could never understand. I've never seen a #1 pencil, but it seems like 2 is perfectly fine for me. We've been through stressful testing situations together, we've been there in situations where people said that I would never be able to operate a pencil like the other kids, we've been there together when we showed them that we could write in cursive in opposition to the proposition that I switch entirely to manual typing.
