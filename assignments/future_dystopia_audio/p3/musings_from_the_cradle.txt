Musings from the Cradle
By Bryce Summers to the tune of a nursury rhyme.


I wonder if she was happy.
following the path thats ahead of me.

I wonder how my life could be.
If I get the numbers that I want to see.

Judging life by my activities.
Effort, stress, and proclivity.

As long as they fall into standard tasks.
I will have fullfilled what society asks.
