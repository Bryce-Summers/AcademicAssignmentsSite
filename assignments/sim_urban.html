<h1>Sim Urban Project Schedule</h1>
<h3>By Bryce Summers</h3>

<p>
This schedule indicates the intended goals and milestones in the design and development of the Sim Urban Project. Without clearly described deadlines, it is unlikely that this project will ever develop into a fun, usable game.

<td>As of April 20th, Sim Urban has completed Iteration #4 where the user can build uniform generic type roads with autmatically generated intersections. Cars are created at dead ends and demonstrate the ability to turn throughout the well formed network. <br> <br></td>

Needless to say, the program is not very game like right now. It only amounts to a toy as it is right now. If this game is to demonstrate transportation engineering and Urban design principles in a fun manner, a lot of work is yet to be done.

<tr>
<td>Apr.27.2017</td>
<td>Draft an Extensibility Plan</td>
<td>
To encourage my potential funders, I will draft a plan detailing how the project may be extended and maintained after I leave the project.
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>May.5.2017</td>
<td>Road Building Game</td>
<td>
The IDM Spring Showcase will be on May 5th, 2017 from 6 - 10pm. The goal is to have a working 'game' involving road building for playtesting during the Spring Showcase.
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>June.1.2017</td>
<td>Multi-Modal, multiple-type roads.</td>
<td>
By ths date, the users should be able to Build roads of several different types, including locals, arterials, collectors, sidewalks, and maybe bike lanes, the users should be able to manage several different streams of traffic.

Streets will genrate buildings along side of them that will produce trip producing passengers.
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>July.1.2017</td>
<td> </td>
<td>
The users should now be able to modify existing streets to implement traffic calming measures and modify street widths.
A data overlay and interface system should be used to provide the user with feedback. Voice acted clips can play on the 'radio' to inform the user of what has transpired.
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>August.1.2017</td>
<td> </td>
<td>
Public transportation may be implemented, such as Rapid Transit Buses, Lyft Pools, etc. Maybe I will handle surg pricing.
