<h1> Doodling and Sketching </h1>
<h3>By Bryce Summers</h3>

<p>

I particularly liked <a href="http://www.alistapart.com/articles/the-miseducation-of-the-doodle/">The Miseducation of the Doodle.</a>

Section 6, which discussed shading and shadowing showed me how simple adding depth cues could be. I decided to try it out myself in my sketchbook. I also like the visual alphabet toolbox. For the "Doodle" set below, my roommate like all of my doodles, except for 4, 5, and 12. He did not like 4 and 5, because he thinks that they look too much like apes hands, because their is nothing to orient him to their anthromorphism. He didn't like 12, because it is kind of like a blob, which doesn't necessarily point to a particular shape. I also did not like 12, because I lacked a clear focus and ended up drawing seemingly random paths and filling in everything with blue.<br><br>

For other set on the right, my roommate did not like 2, 4, and 12, because they didn't have the same inviting shading on the lines, so they were rougher and not as welcoming.<br><br>
